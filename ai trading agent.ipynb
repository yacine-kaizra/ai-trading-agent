        "Stock Market Investment Optimization is an AI-powered application that helps users allocate their investments across multiple companies to maximize return on investment (ROI). The system considers real-time stock market data, individual risk tolerance, and investment goals to provide optimized investment recommendations.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Features\n",
        "- **Real-time Stock Data Collection**: Uses Yahoo Finance's API to fetch stock prices, financial news, and market trends.\n",
        "- **User Input Handling**: Allows users to specify investment capital, risk level (conservative, moderate, aggressive), investment duration, and industry preferences.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Application Components\n",
        "1. **Data Collection & Processing**:\n",
        "   - Fetch historical and real-time stock market data.\n",
        "   - Analyze stock performance metrics (P/E ratio, market cap, price fluctuations, etc.).\n",
        "   - Research market trends and economic forecasts.\n",
        "2. **Optimization Algorithms**:\n",
        "   - Implement and compare Greedy Search, A*, and Simulated Annealing.\n",
        "   - Model portfolio allocation as a CSP.\n",
        "3. **Investment Strategy Dashboard**:\n",
        "   - User-friendly interface for inputting investment parameters.\n",
        "   - Portfolio allocation suggestions with ROI and risk assessment.\n",
